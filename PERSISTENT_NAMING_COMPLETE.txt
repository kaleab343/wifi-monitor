================================================================
   ✅ PERSISTENT DEVICE NAMING - COMPLETE!
================================================================

FEATURE: Device names and types now persist forever!

HOW IT WORKS:
-------------

When You Rename a Device:
-------------------------
1. Right-click device → Select "✏️ Rename Device"
2. Enter new name (e.g., "John's iPhone")
3. Click "💾 Save"
4. Name saved to known_devices.json
5. Display updates immediately

File Structure (known_devices.json):
------------------------------------
{
  "AA:BB:CC:DD:EE:FF": {
    "name": "John's iPhone",
    "type": "iPhone"
  },
  "11:22:33:44:55:66": {
    "name": "Living Room TV",
    "type": "Samsung TV"
  }
}


PERSISTENCE LIFECYCLE:
----------------------

Session 1 (First Time):
  → Scan network
  → See "Unknown Device" at 192.168.1.5
  → Right-click → Rename to "Guest Phone"
  → Set type to "Android Phone"
  → Data saved to known_devices.json

Close App:
  → Exit application
  → known_devices.json remains on disk
  → Your data is safe!

Session 2 (Next Day):
  → Open application again
  → Click "Quick Scan"
  → Device 192.168.1.5 appears as "Guest Phone"
  → Type shows as "Android Phone"
  → No need to rename again!

Session 3 (Week Later):
  → Same thing - name still there!
  → Device 192.168.1.5 = "Guest Phone"
  → Forever and ever! ✓


WHAT PERSISTS:
--------------

✅ Custom Device Names
   - Set via "Rename Device"
   - Stored in known_devices.json
   - Loaded automatically on every scan

✅ Custom Device Types
   - Set via "Set Device Type"
   - Stored in known_devices.json
   - Applied to device display

✅ Across App Restarts
   - Close app → Data saved
   - Reopen app → Data loaded
   - Works every time

✅ Across Multiple Scans
   - Quick Scan → Custom names shown
   - Complete Discovery → Custom names shown
   - MITM Scan → Custom names shown

✅ Even If IP Changes
   - Devices identified by MAC address
   - MAC never changes (unique identifier)
   - Name follows the device anywhere


TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION:
--------------------------

Loading Phase (When App Starts):
---------------------------------
1. User opens app
2. App loads known_devices.json
3. Database stored in memory
4. Ready for display

Display Phase (When Devices Listed):
------------------------------------
1. Scan finds device with MAC AA:BB:CC:DD:EE:FF
2. App checks: "Do I have custom data for this MAC?"
3. Found in database: { "name": "John's iPhone", "type": "iPhone" }
4. Display shows "John's iPhone" instead of generic name
5. Type column shows "iPhone"

Saving Phase (When User Renames):
---------------------------------
1. User right-clicks device
2. Enters new name "My Smart TV"
3. App saves to known_devices.json:
   {
     "AA:BB:CC:DD:EE:FF": {
       "name": "My Smart TV",
       "type": "Samsung TV"
     }
   }
4. Display refreshes immediately
5. File persists on disk


PRIORITY SYSTEM:
----------------

Device Name Priority (Top to Bottom):
--------------------------------------
1. Custom Name (from known_devices.json) ⭐ HIGHEST
2. NetBIOS Name (from Windows discovery)
3. mDNS Name (from Apple/Bonjour)
4. SSDP Name (from UPnP discovery)
5. DHCP Hostname (from network)
6. Generic Name (e.g., "Device 192.168.1.5") ⭐ LOWEST

Device Type Priority:
---------------------
1. Custom Type (from known_devices.json) ⭐ HIGHEST
2. Detected Type (from MAC database / discovery)
3. "Unknown Device" ⭐ LOWEST


TESTING PERSISTENCE:
--------------------

Test 1: Rename and Restart
---------------------------
1. Open app → Scan devices
2. Find "Unknown Device" at 192.168.1.5
3. Right-click → Rename to "Test Device"
4. Close app completely
5. Reopen app
6. Scan devices
7. ✓ Device shows as "Test Device"

Test 2: Type and Restart
-------------------------
1. Right-click device → "Set Device Type"
2. Choose "Smart TV"
3. Close app
4. Reopen app
5. Scan devices
6. ✓ Device type shows as "Smart TV"

Test 3: Multiple Sessions
--------------------------
Day 1: Rename "Device A" to "John's Phone"
Day 2: Still shows "John's Phone" ✓
Day 7: Still shows "John's Phone" ✓
Day 30: Still shows "John's Phone" ✓


DATABASE LOCATION:
------------------

File: known_devices.json
Location: Same folder as hybrid_router_gui.py
Format: JSON (human-readable)
Size: ~100 bytes per device
Backup: Copy this file to backup your names!


BACKUP & RESTORE:
-----------------

To Backup Your Device Names:
  1. Copy known_devices.json
  2. Save to USB/Cloud
  3. Your custom names are safe!

To Restore:
  1. Copy known_devices.json back
  2. Paste in app folder
  3. Restart app
  4. All names restored!

To Share with Another Computer:
  1. Copy known_devices.json
  2. Put on new computer
  3. Same custom names!


EDITING MANUALLY:
-----------------

You can edit known_devices.json directly:

{
  "A6:57:18:57:C1:53": {
    "name": "Guest iPhone",
    "type": "iPhone"
  }
}

Add more devices:
{
  "A6:57:18:57:C1:53": {
    "name": "Guest iPhone",
    "type": "iPhone"
  },
  "E0:51:D8:D7:13:B9": {
    "name": "Living Room TV",
    "type": "Samsung TV"
  }
}

Then restart app → Names loaded!


LOGS & DEBUGGING:
-----------------

When app loads custom names, you'll see:
  📌 Using saved name for AA:BB:CC:DD:EE:FF: John's iPhone
  📌 Using saved type for AA:BB:CC:DD:EE:FF: iPhone

When you save a name:
  ✓ Renamed device AA:BB:CC:DD:EE:FF to 'John's iPhone'
  💾 Name saved permanently to known_devices.json

When loading fails:
  ⚠ Could not load known devices: [error message]


COMMON SCENARIOS:
-----------------

Scenario 1: Unknown Device → Named
  Before: "Unknown Device" (192.168.1.5)
  Action: Rename to "Mom's iPad"
  After:  "Mom's iPad" (192.168.1.5)
  Forever: Always shows "Mom's iPad" ✓

Scenario 2: Generic Name → Personal
  Before: "Huawei Phone" (192.168.1.2)
  Action: Rename to "My Phone"
  After:  "My Phone" (192.168.1.2)
  Forever: Always shows "My Phone" ✓

Scenario 3: MAC Changes IP
  Day 1: "John's iPhone" at 192.168.1.5
  Day 2: Same device at 192.168.1.8
  Result: Still shows "John's iPhone" ✓
  Why: Tracked by MAC (AA:BB:CC:DD:EE:FF), not IP


BENEFITS:
---------

✅ Never rename the same device twice
✅ Organize your network with meaningful names
✅ Know exactly which device is which
✅ Persist across reboots, scans, sessions
✅ Easy to backup and restore
✅ Manual editing possible
✅ Works with all 3 scan methods


LIMITATIONS:
------------

❌ If MAC address changes (privacy/randomization)
   → Device will appear as new
   → Need to rename again
   
❌ If known_devices.json is deleted
   → All custom names lost
   → Backup recommended!


================================================================
   🎉 YOUR DEVICE NAMES ARE NOW PERMANENT!
================================================================

No more "Unknown Device"!
No more generic names!
No more renaming after restart!

Set it once, use it forever! 💾

Enjoy your organized network! 🚀
